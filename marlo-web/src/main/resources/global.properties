# Glossary Content
home.glossary.interoperable=Interoperable
home.glossary.interoperable.definition=A deliverables is interoperable when: <br> <ul><li>The deliverable is published on a repository that implements a metadata schema (In the CGIAR we use the CGCore Metadata Schema which is based on Dublin Core standard).</li><li>The deliverable is published on a repository that implements an interoperability protocol (i.e. CGspace https://cgspace.cgiar.org/ or Dataverse).</li><li>The (meta) data uses a formal, accessible, shared, and broadly applicable language for knowledge representation.</li><li>The (meta) data uses vocabularies that follow FAIR principles (<b>F</b>indable, <b>A</b>ccessible, <b>I</b>nteroperable and <b>R</b>eusable).</li><li>The (meta) data includes qualified references to other (meta) data.</li></ul>
# Glossary Content
home.glossary.accountability=Accountability
home.glossary.accountability.definition=Accountability is a concept used with many definitions and in many contexts (bureaucratic, political, professional, legal).  In governance and management it can be defined as the duty to ensure and report that the use of authority is aligned with rules, standards, policy and interests of the program, organization and the broader group of stakeholders. Its assessment looks at the extent to which it is defined, accepted, and exercised along the chain of command and control within a program. In the context of research for development, accountability can be seen the obligation to take responsibility for performance in light of commitments, to the extent that performance is in the control of the program/project. Accountability requires ownership and acceptance of responsibility and the ability to deliver or influence the delivery of the desired results.
home.glossary.mutualAccountability=Mutual accountability
home.glossary.mutualAccountability.definition=In the context of the CGIAR, this refers to the accountability of all partners, including donors, for the efficiency of outputs, outcomes and impacts of a program, institution or policy and sustainability of research.
home.glossary.activities=Activities
home.glossary.activities.definition=We consider size 250K USD multi-year activities. We need to ensure that we are capturing also activities that are smaller than that, but yet key in achieving the set outcomes. Therefore, we need to enfold them as an activity within your project larger activities. Activities like this will be led by an <b>Activity Leader</b>.
home.glossary.adoption=Adoption
home.glossary.adoption.definition=In research for development impact pathways, adoption, use and uptake refer to the primary and direct use of the research output by beneficiaries.  This use may lead to changes; i.e. outcomes and impacts. Influence is a related term that implies an effect of research results on the primary beneficiaries or course of events.
home.glossary.appraisal=Appraisal
home.glossary.appraisal.definition=An ex\u2010ante assessment of the quality, relevance, feasibility and potential for impact and sustainability of a research program or activity, usually prior to a decision on funding it.
home.glossary.attribution=Attribution
home.glossary.attribution.definition=The causality between observed (or expected) changes and an output from research or related activity.  Attribution refers to both isolating and estimating the particular contribution of a program/project to the outcome/impact.
home.glossary.audit=Audit
home.glossary.audit.definition=Financial and management audit in the CGIAR provides accountability to management at the level of the Center Boards, Consortium and Fund Council on finances and assets and also provide elements of oversight in human resources and business efficiency.
home.glossary.baseline=Baseline
home.glossary.baseline.definition=An analytical description of the situation prior to research activities, against which progress can be assessed or comparisons made. This can include stakeholder analyses, social network analyses, policy analyses, other on-going initiatives inventory, etc.
home.glossary.behavioralIndependence=Behavioral independence
home.glossary.behavioralIndependence.definition=see Independence
home.glossary.beneficiaries=Beneficiaries
home.glossary.beneficiaries.definition=The individuals, groups, or organizations, whether targeted or not, that benefit, directly or indirectly, from the chain of events that research has contributed to (see also Target Group).
home.glossary.budget=CCAFS Budget
home.glossary.budget.definition=Is what is put forth through CCAFS and covers Window 1 (W1), Window 2 (W2), Window 3 (W3) and bilaterally raised funds by CGIAR centers, excluding leveraged funds from non-CG partners.
home.glossary.budget.definition.w1=<b>W1</b>\: Funds to support the entire CGIAR program portfolio including through CRPs as well as to proposals from the consortium for support to other critical activities that are vital for successful implementation of the strategy and results framework.
home.glossary.budget.definition.w2=<b>W2</b>\: Funds designated to one or more of the CRPs
home.glossary.budget.definition.w3=<b>W3</b>\: Donor funds specifically earmarked to a CRP through a center
home.glossary.budget.definition.bilateral=<b>Bilateral</b>\: Funds raised directly by CGIAR Centers through concepts notes and proposals. Centers decide to which CRP they want to map their bilateral and not the donor who decides.
home.glossary.clusterOfActivities=Clusters of Activities
home.glossary.clusterOfActivities.definition=Are structural components of a CRP flagship. They are the summary description of a range of products that are linked and related with each other e.g. through their contribution towards an outcome.
home.glossary.clients=Clients
home.glossary.clients.definition=In these standards this term refers to the primary clients of evaluation \u2013 those requesting or receiving the evaluation (for example senior managers or donors of a CRP).  Elsewhere it is often used to refer to the target group for a research project.
home.glossary.comparativeAdvantage=Comparative advantage
home.glossary.comparativeAdvantage.definition=In economic terms, a comparative advantage in producing or selling a good is possessed by an individual, firm or country with the lowest opportunity cost (as opposed to absolute cost) in producing the good.  In these standards the term refers more broadly to the role and mandate of the CGIAR in producing international public goods where there are no alternative research suppliers that are better positioned to produce those goods.
home.glossary.costEffectiveness=Cost effectiveness
home.glossary.costEffectiveness.definition=The extent to which the program has achieved or is expected to achieve its results at a lower cost compared with alternatives. Cost\u2010effectiveness analysis is distinct from cost\u2010benefit analysis, which assigns a monetary value to the measure of effect. In research programs costing of outputs is more feasible than outcomes that typically depend on conditions and activities outside of research.
home.glossary.counterfactual=Counterfactual
home.glossary.counterfactual.definition=The situation or condition which (hypothetically) would have prevailed if there had been no program/project.
home.glossary.deliverables=Deliverables
home.glossary.deliverables.definition=A <b>deliverable</b> is a specific, tangible product generated by a project, such as a workshop report, paper, dataset, scenario, etc.  Each deliverable contributes to one key-output. Unlike key outputs which are generic categories, deliverables are specific and time bound, with an expected year of completion.

At CCAFS we define outcomes as the changes in next-users that need to happen so that an enabling environment is created and the targeted impact can occur. These are medium-term practice changes that occur through the adoption, use or influence of the research product by the next-users, who end up doing things in different ways. These practice changes are underpinned by the related necessary changes in knowledge, attitudes and/or skills.  What do next-users need to <strong>DO</strong> to contribute to the enabling environment needed for achieving the targeted impact? In CCAFS we have 2 levels of outcomes, with 2019 outcomes shared between regions and flagships contributing to 2025 outcomes.
