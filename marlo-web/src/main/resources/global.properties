# Project Studies
projectStudies.help=Ultimately, it is in the Centers/Projects interest to report on outcomes as these get picked up in annual reports and get attention with donors; and at various points projects and Centers are assessed in their delivery of good/excellent outcomes. However, we recognise that reporting on outcomes from one project each year is not feasible, thus this section is voluntary.<br /><br />If you do not categorize your outcome properly, it will not be aggregated to the synthesis level and will therefore not be counted in reporting.  Please be careful to:<br/>1. Link to an SRF<br/>2. Indicate the most appropriate SLO targets.

All stages of maturity are important and interesting for reporting.  There is particular demand, however, for case studies which document ex-post, at-scale impacts showing linkages to the CGIAR Strategic Results Framework System Level Outcomes and targets.

deliverable.typeOfActivity.help=Click here to see the different types of activities and their description
deliverable.typeOfActivity.title= SMO Activity/Event Types
deliverable.typeOfActivity.description=Description
deliverable.typeOfActivity.cocreation=Co-creation event
deliverable.typeOfActivity.cocreation.description=This includes events such as learning platforms, multi-stakeholder platforms, innovation platforms, Learning Alliances, the co-design of projects, writeshops, prototyping events, virtual meeting events, or hackathons. These activities may indirectly have some capacity development outcomes but are distinguished from previous categories by not having significant, written, capdev/training objectives. Co-Creation events are distinguished from knowledge exchanges by having defined end products, which are created jointly.
deliverable.typeOfActivity.academic=Formal Training: Academic Degree
deliverable.typeOfActivity.academic.description=A PhD, Masters, or other type of student (fellowship, postdoc, BSc, etc.) For inclusion in this category, the trainee must have a formal agreement with the host institution and defined learning objectives.
deliverable.typeOfActivity.longTerm=Formal Training: Long training course/activity
deliverable.typeOfActivity.longTerm.description=This includes training events with multiple (more than two) sessions often spread out over a longer period of time. For example, a distance course, series of seminars, or farmer field school activity lasting more than two days. These can be online or face-to-face and can occur in the field or based within an institution. For inclusion in this category, the activity must have written training objectives.
deliverable.typeOfActivity.oneOff=Formal Training: One-off training event
deliverable.typeOfActivity.oneOff.description=This might include a one-off multi-day workshop, seminar, or 1-2 day training event. These can be online or face-to-face, and can occur in the field or based within an institution. For inclusion in this category, the activity must have written training objectives.
deliverable.typeOfActivity.research=Formal Training: Research placement or training visit
deliverable.typeOfActivity.research.description=This includes sabbaticals, interns, and researchers and related professions (e.g. comms, finance) visiting from other institutions. For inclusion in this category, the trainee must have a formal agreement with the host institution and defined learning objectives.
deliverable.typeOfActivity.knowledge=Knowledge exchange
deliverable.typeOfActivity.knowledge.description=Knowledge exchange activities might include an open house (e.g. for farmers, schools, partners, alumni, or community members), tour (lab tour, visiting partners for research, or staff capacity building event), conference, focus group activity, field event, or workshop, webinars. These activities may indirectly have some capacity development outcomes but are distinguished from previous categories by not having significant, written, capdev/training objectives. Knowledge exchanges do not normally result in a defined end product.
deliverable.typeOfActivity.scaling=Scaling activities
deliverable.typeOfActivity.scaling.description=Includes participants receiving technical assistance (e.g. extension services, farmer field schools, nutrition-related education, etc.) or direct participants in input distribution activities such as seed or fertilizer distribution activities.
deliverable.typeOfActivity.trials=Trials and studies
deliverable.typeOfActivity.trials.description=This includes participants in lab and field trials (including on-farm trials), and direct participants in nutrition studies, impact evaluations and other research studies (soil research, integrated pest management, etc.).

Please provide information on all relevant SRF targets for a single study or innovation, to the extent possible. Example: please see in the 2017 report Annex Table A how findings from a single rice review have been allocated between targets for adoption, poverty and yield increases. Insofar as possible, please also disaggregate the effect of different innovations (e.g. in the above example NERICA rice could potentially be separated from another group of CGIAR rice varieties). <br /><br />If the adoption or impact data comes from a relevant innovation or contribution of the CGIAR prior to the CRP start-up (e.g. varieties released before the CRP start-up, which for most CRPs would be approximately 2012), then please support statements with published references, as shown in the 2017 Annual Report Annex Table A above. <u>Nearly all adoption or impact studies fall into the above category.</u> There are (as yet) a <u>few</u> cases (two in 2017) in which the estimated figures for at-scale adoption or impact result from an innovation released within the CRP period, for example some biofortification numbers in 2017. If this is the case, then the statement <u>must</u> be supported by a link to an Outcome/ Impact Case Report <b>Maturity Level 3</b> (preferably in the Results Dashboard or if not, with unique identifier from any appropriate repository, e.g. CGSpace).<br /><br />For any help or further clarification, please contact <u>planningandreporting@cgiar.org</u>

summaries.lp6contribution.description=LP6 will generate, translate and synthesize climate change knowledge at the regional and global levels so that CSA actions can reach millions of farmers and key stakeholders from the rural world. LP6, along with a strong knowledge management and communications strategy, will leverage partnerships, capacity building, global outreach and climate finance to achieve climate outcomes at scale. This will provide an enabling environment to bring more quality solutions in the context of climate variability, climate change and uncertainty about future climate conditions to more farmers in a fast and equitable manner.<br /><br />Key actions of LP6 include the following:<br /><br />1.  INTEGRATING: LP6 will consolidate CCAFS as the climate change leader across the CGIAR. The latter includes working towards breaking down barriers among centres and CRPs, making connections among scientists, promoting regional to global linkages, and better CRP to CRP connections. <br />2. SYNTHESISING AND RESEARCHING: LP6 will deliver demand driven knowledge with respect to metrics, scalable approaches, more radical/innovative/sexier options and best bets by country/agro-ecological zone in order to address knowledge needs of regional and global policy processes and partners. <br />3.  ENGAGING: LP6 will use global reach to facilitate connections, opportunities, sharing of knowledge, and engagement of CRPs and Centres in events and partnerships.<br/>4. CATALYZING INVESTMENT: LP6 will support innovative  solutions that can remove barriers and increase climate investments in land-use. It will do so by strengthening capacities, generating cutting edge knowledge, developing and delivering demand-driven products and services and promoting innovative partnerships and collaboration.<br/>5.  COMMUNICATING: LP6 will work closely with diverse type of partners to generate and implement communication strategies so that the CGIAR work on climate change can reach millions of people around the world. <br/>6. ENHANCING CAPACITY: LP6 will provide tools and options so that the agricultural community, including the research community, private and public sector, farmers\u2019 organizations, and national and international agencies, are able to implement options provided to tackle the climate change challenge.
