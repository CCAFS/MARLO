The project combines research, in-country capacity building for research, technical assistance and technology transfer, and policy engagement at sub-national, national, and international levels. The project is structured into four research modules (on policies and governance; the assessment of REDD+ projects on the ground; understanding MRV issues; and addressing landscape level challenges and private sector contributions to REDD+) and one knowledge-sharing module - designed to deliver salient, credible and legitimate knowledge products that address important gaps in REDD+ policy design and implementation. Through co-production of knowledge, partners will develop their technical capacity to address policy and implementation challenges and assist in dissemination, multiplication and uptake of research results. The project builds on the experience of the CIFOR-led “Global Comparative Study on REDD+” which has demonstrated the catalytic potential of combining research, capacity building, and partner engagement to bridge the science-policy divide. Building on this experience, the project will expand to work with a wide range of stakeholders in NICFI priority countries to promote changes in policy and practice towards reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation and enhancing forest carbon sinks. The project contributes mainly to NICFI’s Outcome 2 (governments in targeted developing countries have implemented REDD+-related policies), and supports private sector initiatives under NICFI Outcome 3 (private sector actors). Bringing national and sub-national level research results into the international debate contributes to NICFI Outcome 1 (REDD+ incentives through an international climate regime). We work with many national research partners such as ICEL (Indonesia), DAR (Peru), and Hawassa University, Ethiopia; the Universities of As (NMUB; Norway), Wageningen (NL), Helsinki (Finland), and North Carolina (USA). We intend to coordinate our work with that of two other NICFI applicants: Earth Innovation Institute and the Governor’s Climate and Forests Task Force (GCF). Main target groups are (1) REDD+ policy-makers at international, national and sub-national levels; (2) civil society organizations (CSOs) active in REDD+ discussion and action, including non-governmental organizations (NGOs), movements representing indigenous peoples and forest dependent communities, foundations and other NICFI grantees; (3) proponent organizations and relevant private sector actors; and (4) roundtables and networks such as the GCF; and (5) REDD+ donors, multilateral and implementing agencies. In some cases we will work directly with target agencies; in other cases we will work with national partners who have the capacity, networks and mandates to reach key national decision-makers and practitioners with information more effectively. We will assess REDD+ policies and activities in the seven NICFI countries where we have worked before (Brazil, Democratic Republic of Congo, Ethiopia, Guyana, Indonesia, Peru and Vietnam), and include a new country, Myanmar, which is receptive to REDD+ and where deforestation rates are particularly high. In-depth studies of REDD+ demonstration projects will be undertaken in Brazil, Indonesia, and Peru; we will address MRV and landscape level policy and management in Ethiopia, Guyana, Indonesia, Myanmar, and Peru.','2016-01-01','2020-12-31','PMO-1283',10752688.17,'Christopher Martius','C.Martius@cgiar.org',NULL,NULL,317,2,3,NULL,11,false,false,false,NULL,NULL,3,'2017-12-11 13:48:02',3,'',1);

The FORETS Project "FOrmation, Research, Environment in TShopo" is an Action mainly funded from the resources of the 11th European Development Fund. A total estimated budget of € 27,120,000 is foreseen to cover all expenses of its implementation over a period of sixty months, presumably between October 2016 and September 2021. Action is defined as a substantial contribution to integrated landscape development including the Yangambi Biosphere Reserve in the Democratic Republic of Congo. It aims at specific objectives relating to the conservation and enhancement of biodiversity and ecosystem services in order to contribute to the sustainable development of local populations. The activities defined on the Yangambi-Kisangani axis in the Tshopo Province concern not only support to local communities through awareness raising, extension and supervision, but also the strengthening of national human resources, in particular Through formal LMD-type courses. The Action aims to embrace a range of socio-economic development opportunities within a landscape of about four hundred thousand hectares and directly or indirectly affecting a rural and urban population of about one million people.

As governments and development agencies seek ways to mitigate and adapt to the effects of climate change, the Eastern Himalayan region is a key focal area for research and action due to the combination of ecological and social vulnerability.  With an expected increase in the frequency of floods as well as droughts, the enhancement of forest ecosystem services and the management of timber harvesting on slopes is urgently required. At the same time, rural poverty concerns and a rich tradition of participatory approaches in South Asia represent both a challenge and an opportunity for aligning efforts that mitigate severe climate effects.  This project''s first objective is to assess the status and trends of ecosystem service provision for community forests and government reserve forests (GRFs), and to determine the expectations of residents and the government vis-a-vis the rehabilitation of degraded forest.  The second objective is to determine what drives unsustainable timber harvest in both community forests and GRFs, and the impacts of this on timber stocks and ecosystem services.  CIFOR''s local partner is Bhutan''s environmental research and training center, UWICE, which provides training to forest actors and environmental professionals and evaluates forest management schemes. Local governments and village members are also integrated into the project''s activities.  Our assessment of current forest management schemes and the trade-offs between forest resource demands and forest ecosystem service provision will support efforts in climate change mitigation and adaptation, productive forestry and agro-forestry programs, and water and watershed management.

The nutritious nuts, harvested from the wild, are one of the most economically important non-timber forest products in the world.  Annual exports of Brazil nuts are valued at tens of millions of US dollars, but only a small fraction is sourced ethically through certification. Brazil nut harvesting is a crucial part of rural livelihoods across the Amazon region. The same rural communities also depend on timber harvesting from the same forests to keep them above the poverty line. Forest degradation, as a consequence of unplanned intensive timber harvesting, has potentially negative consequences for Brazil nut production, biodiversity conservation, and climate change.  This project is focusing on the Madre de Dios region of Peru, which contains 26,000 square kilometers of the most biologically diverse and carbon dense Brazil nut-rich forest in South America.  The ultimate aim of this project is to help COOP develop a resilient value supply chain for certified and sustainable Brazil nuts from Peru. This will provide an opportunity to alleviate poverty, conserve tropical forest and mitigate climate change through reduced forest degradation.  Despite the excellent nutritional and health properties of Brazil nuts, they remain a peripheral food product in the Swiss market. This project is using an interdisciplinary systems-based approach to:  a) Provide the scientific basis for the certification of sustainably harvested Brazil nuts through a clear understanding of how habitat degradation influences Brazil nut production;  b) Understand and reduce the barriers harvesters face in adopting certification (Fairtrade and Organic) of Brazil nuts due to unpredictable demand, and lack of local capacity;  c) Raise consumer awareness in Switzerland of the nutritional, environmental and social benefits of certified Brazil nuts to sustain a larger and more resilient supply chain.

This study, which compared forest fragmentation patterns in six EVD outbreak sites with a sample of randomly selected sites outside these, found that forest fragmentation was higher in the EVD sites. The inference made from these results is that forest fragmentation, in affecting the foraging and roosting habits of bats, may be indirectly responsible for the expansion of the bat-humans interface, and in so doing increase the risk of EVD. The ERM report also makes a passing suggestion that habitat fragmentation could also increase hunting of smaller prey that become more abundant (linked to the loss of large-bodied fauna), and hence intensifies contact with wild animals. Although the ERM study is probably the first institution to empirically examine possible connections between the state of the forest and EVD outbreaks, its results are still not conclusive. This is because of the small number of sites investigated (6 out of a possible 91 outbreaks) as well as the lack of any tests of alternative hypotheses to investigate the individual influence or interaction of different factors that may be linked to the outbreaks. Given the attention that the ERM report is likely to receive on its publication (planned for the week of 10th August 2015), it is urgent to complete more robust investigations to corroborate if indeed there is a link between Ebola virus outbreaks and deforestation and forest fragmentation. If this association is satisfactorily validated, such a finding could allow a clear entry point to further understand the conditions that increase the risk of Ebola outbreaks and propose adequate mitigation strategies. To evaluate, using spatial and temporal analysis, whether known deforestation episodes and patterns of habitat fragmentation significantly explain the occurrence of reported EVD outbreaks in humans and in animals. We will also examine the relationship between deforestation and habitat fragmentation, changes in potential human-animal contact brought about by land conversion, and the known Ebola outbreaks.

A key driver of these changes in rural areas is a transition away from traditional agriculture to oil palm production. The rapid expansion of oil palm has drawn attention from conservationists for its environmental impacts, but it is also changing local food systems and food environments. In the face of rapid change and potential loss of positive dietary traditions, it is essential to understand how changes from traditional to commercial agriculture are affecting the food choices of farmers in rural Indonesia. The aim of this project is to provide the research community, local communities, policy makers, and international donors with evidence that can be used to help create a food environment that is more conducive to healthier food choices in rural Indonesia. The project will be carried out in two sites in Indonesia that are undergoing this process of transformation.

Farmers have improved access to markets for inputs, finance and products and rural advisory services and are encouraged to use agroforestry and integrated soil fertility management (ISFM) practices so that they can sustainably increase production and incomes. The increased incomes and supply of tree products will incentivise smallholders to adopt and continue to use sustainable production practices, as well as help accelerate adoption of agroforestry and ISFM among smallholder farmers. The approach also combines climate change mitigation with agricultural adaption strategies and is based on in-depth understanding of the dynamics that have prevented a wider uptake of sustainable land management practices by small holder farmers in spite of dwindling productivity and widespread demonstration of techniques such as Conservation Farming in Zambia.','2016-02-15','2019-02-14','SNDO-1179',149364.25,'Godfrey Kundhlande','G.Kundhlande@cgiar.org',NULL,NULL,1666,2,3,NULL,11,false,false,false,NULL,NULL,3,'2017-12-11 13:48:03',3,'',1);

If observed in the field, the typology will also be extended to classify where rattan becomes planted as part of swidden/agroforest cycles, and where it is grown in dedicated plantations (with selected trees as support). With such typology and existing land cover data the assessment will get a first stratification of the potential rattan supply across the various main producing regions in Cameroon. 2. Undertake Ground truthing in selected location (within the stratification of step 1) will assess the existing standing stock, as well as recent harvesting activity; 3. Aligned with 2, undertake a focus group discussion on constraints and opportunities can bring out the local perspectives on the price at which harvesting rattan is considered worthwhile and what the local alternatives are that set the opportunity cost of labour. 4.
