The CCAFS gender survey, Phase 2 was developed by CIAT and partners using this framework to collect sex-disaggregated data about perceptions of climate change, awareness and adoption of CSA practices, access to information, access/control of factors of production, decision-making, division of labor, etc., which allows us to understand the potential ways gender differences influence adaptation to climate change and how different CSA practices might impact gender differences.\r\n6. http://ciat.cgiar.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/policy_brief_global_diets.pdf\r\n7.LivestockPlus Concept: Livestock Plus strategic inititaive.

Is Cassava the Answer to African Climate Change Adaptation? \r\n\r\n* Uptake in the popular press was tremendous, including live radio interviews.  The story appeared in BBC, Scientific American, NBS, MSN, and in important daily papers form across the globe.  The stories made reference to cassava as a Rambo Root.Beyond media impact, the Rambo Root phrase is currently being used by the Global Cassava partnership (funded by the Gates Foundation) as the primary communications instrument for attracting more attention to the crop.  The significant exposure has resulted in renewed attention being given to Cassava as an orphan crop with significant potential to contribute to adaptation.

Engagement with national meteorological services in Tanzania, Malawi and Ghana around novel data analysis tools is improving their planning processes. Priority setting reviews of adaptation options in mixed crop-livestock systems were carried out; that these are still substantially under-researched was echoed in the INDCs of some countries.', 'In EA, new methods were developed around zonal and systems approaches, to integrate gender equity considerations within rapid multi-indicator surveys. Applications are envisaged at multiple sites to produce a global analysis of the interplay between agriculture, gender and nutrition. Projects in SA collected gender disaggregated information for priority setting. IFPRI used the Women’s Empowerment in Agriculture Index to understand gender roles in decision-making and highlight gender dimensions in government policies and programs. Case studies on gender have been carried out in Vietnam, Myanmar (by PIRCCA) and the Philippines (by IFPRI), with the aim of identifying areas where interventions are most needed. In WA, women were well represented in the nine districts in which scenarios work was carried out. In Tanzania, Malawi and Ghana, women were included specifically in PICSA farmer training.  Syntheses of baselines work in WA and EA are highlighting several key GSI elements in these CCAFS sites.'), ('89', '4', '178', '2015', 'The post-2015 UNFCCC agreement, announced in Paris in December 2015, established a sound international governance framework for climate action. It has an explicit focus on food security, ensuring that agriculture is a sector for action. CCAFS made several written contributions to SBSTA processes. Documented RBM is starting to inform institutional change processes in several organizations. CCAFS science contributed to three submissions (on early warning systems, risks and vulnerability in agricultural systems, and gender and climate change) made by the African Group of Negotiators to UNFCCC discussions. IFAD is adopting CIAT/CCAFS science in project design and implementation in several countries (Nicaragua, Comoros, Liberia, Uganda). IFAD/ASAP projects worth >USD 100 million are using CCAFS/CIAT climate science.  A regional workshop on CSA (UNEP, PIRCCA) included participants from 13 Asian countries and regional (ASEAN CRN) stakeholders; concept notes are being drafted for funding from the AP-CTNFC.  CCAFS helped to set up and support a WA CSA alliance and intervention framework, assisting AUC and NEPAD in developing a technical guide and roadmap for informing NAIPs to achieve the CAADP goals. PICSA interacted with WFP, ADRA, Oxfam and CARE, using their science and tools to bring the climate services needs of smallholder farmers more to the fore. FAO Council adopted CGRFA guidelines in 2015, designed to assist 189 country members in climate change adaptation planning. Reviews were undertaken of which governance arrangements may positively influence food system dynamics and increase food security, the discourses surrounding CSA, and the major governance issues associated with transformations.', 'CCAFS research helped support AGN and civil society groups to prepare submissions on gender and climate change to SBSTA. The CGRFA guidelines provide examples of how national programs can encourage socially marginalized groups to take advantage of the ITPGRFA for CC adaptation. Decision makers in LAM contributed to knowledge products on gender integration in climate change policies in the agricultural sector, increasing gender sensitivity in policymaking processes. In SEA, PIRCCA research is helping to prioritize future gender intervention points. The CCSL is continuing to gather evidence about the efficacy of social learning approaches, revolving around gender-inclusive engagement and learning in research programs to improve development outcomes. Gender received attention in about 40% of the INDCs submitted ahead of COP21. A policy brief on supporting women farmers in a changing climate was developed and disseminated in the lead up to COP21 and informed the updated guide to the negotiations on agriculture.'), ('90', '4', '179', '2015', 'CCAFS continued to engage with the major global players investing in agriculture, including the public sector (World Bank, IFAD, FAO) and the private sector (World Business Council for Sustainable Development). The investment choices of these agencies are likely to become clear in 2016.  CCAFS science has contributed to UNEP’s GEO6 report. Several scientific contributions were made to “CSA 101”, a World Bank e-course for projects and planners. Regarding CCAFS scenarios (led by Oxford University), research was implemented by UNU for ECOWAS on strategies for agriculture and food security planning under climate change. CCAFS collaborated with policy makers on contextualizing the SA regional scenarios in different countries. WWF used CCAFS’s SEA scenarios for an ADB investment document. The Cambodian government was supported by CCAFS to use scenarios methodologies for a project in the ASEAN CSR network.  With Oxfam Asia, a scenarios process on climate adaptation was developed for the Philippines. Future scenarios for the Pacific region were developed by CCAFS and many partners, and these are being built on to guide investments in the region through SPC. IFPRI and partner CGIAR Centres have been improving the IMPACT partial equilibrium model, and the results of model runs have enhanced understanding of the impacts of climate change on food security and informed policy and investment discussions within OECD and FAO. An ICRAF tool has been developed for priority setting and large-scale decision-making across SSA.  The linking of global foresight work with more localised evaluations of different interventions remains work in progress.', 'During the many Oxford University / CCAFS scenario workshops held during 2015, gender balances were monitored, along with the representation of vulnerable groups, in designing and running workshop processes to ensure appropriate participation. IFPRI with a range of partners is carrying out research to link results from the IMPACT partial equilibrium model of the agricultural sector to CGE models. This will provide insights into labour markets, disaggregated by gender, adding an important gender dimension to model (and scenario) outputs. Ongoing research on developing a decision support tool for the World Bank and other investors has an explicit focus on gender and social inclusion.

For instance, through the WA Regional Program and through a bi-lateral USAID project mapped to P4S, CCAFS scientists and partners served as the technical specialists for an ECOWAS forum on climate-smart agriculture sponsored by USAID in May 2015. CCAFS science on CSA was used to inform the development of an CSA intervention Framework for WA and the creation/structuring of workstreams. This set up the relationship for future engagements with ECOWAS on CSA. Furthermore, P4S provided technical information to iNGO partner (World Vision) to support their new Niger strategy. The information developed for Niger served as an early testbed for P4S\' RHO (Risk-Household-Options) modeling framework (see Lamanna et al. CCAFS InfoNote). In West Africa, a synthesis report on the current status of CSV models developed is being produced to foster the dissemination and adoption of best bet CSA options in the region.

Also, the research being conducted on best bet CSA options in West Africa involved the use of a methodological document developed by ILRI which foresees that all social groups and genders are considered from the inventory stage up to the testing and validation stages. Moreover, gender outcomes are being developed and integrated as part of the RHO approach. In a bid to improve the gender research strategies of CCAFS West Africa partners, CCAFS developed and implemented with NARS partners three gender research activities to fill the gaps of knowledge in terms of gender and climate change in West Africa.

In Mali and Senegal, local scenarios and the ASSAR project outcomes have informed the refinery of local policies to integrate climate change and food security dimensions. Meanwhile, the Senegalese Ministry of Agriculture is now using CIS as an agricultural input that guides yearly agricultural action planning. In Burkina Faso, a new scenario-guided planning process was initiated with the government through SP-CSPA, to develop the new plan for rural sector development (PNSR). What was exceptional is that this was a cross-CRP effort, led by CCAFS with FTA, WLE and Dryland Systems – where integrated research plans were made to complement government plans. Through the science-policy platform in Mali, two major CSA options have been identified and evidenced as candidate options for large scale investement. WA scenarios expanded to provide inputs to a UNU project which provides direct recommendations to ECOWAS. Further, CCAFS knowledge supported ECOWAS to now effectively mainstream CSA into regional and national agricultural policies through the CSA alliance (WACSAA) and implementation Framework.', 'In Ghana, both men and women farmers were included in the PICSA trainings and the development of the prototype apps. In addition, gender was mainstreamed in the development processes of the national CSA action plan of Ghana as well as the West Africa CSA alliance. Similarly, gender balance, as well as the representation of vulnerable groups, was always taken into account in workshops and the scenario-guided planning process that led to the development of the new PNSR – plan for rural sector development in Burkina Faso. During the implementation of the project: \"Capacitating science-policy exchange platforms to mainstream climate change into national agricultural and food security policy plans\", a social differentiation study was conducted to map the different categories of stakeholder in the districts targeted. Further, in 2015, 21%; 33% and 13% of the platform members engaged in the scenarios development were women, respectively in Ghana, Mali and Senegal.

Kenya, Uganda, Tanzania, Botswana and Namibia developed validated CSA framework programs based on CCAFS outputs. Kenya, Uganda and Tanzania integrated CSA into INDCs. Rakai and Luwero districts in Uganda integrated CC priorities in five-year development plans. Tanzania and Ghana Met Services are better meeting climate information needs of smallholder farmers. INDCs were strengthened in Colombia and Costa Rica via scenarios, and Honduras strengthened its NAP for the Agricultural Sector. CCAFS helped achieve the Declaration of Central American Countries supporting CSA announced during COP21. Bangladesh’s NAP for agriculture and seventh Five-Year Plan were supported, as were plans for implementing CSA/CSVs in Madhya Pradesh and Nepal.  CCAFS supported the Cambodia National Assembly on CSA. Investment policies are being formulated for Philippine National Climate Change Action Plans. Vietnam’s INDC for agriculture was supported, and that country’s rice sector restructuring and Myanmar’s CSA strategy (Ministry of Agriculture and Irrigation). Ghana’s national CSA action plan was strengthened. Local policies were refined in Mali and Senegal to integrate CC and food security dimensions. The Senegalese Ministry of Agriculture now uses climate information services to guide annual planning. Burkina Faso developed a new plan for the rural sector (PNSR) using scenarios.  “Competent authority” decrees, new agrobiodiversity policies and/or confirmations of PGRFA in MLS were achieved in Bhutan, Guatemala, Rwanda, Costa Rica, Nepal, Uganda and Burkina Faso.', 'National CSA-FPs are highlighting the integration of gender and youth in developing CSA interventions through value chain integration in EA. Women farmers are being considered explicitly in the development of CIS apps. Gender balance and representation of vulnerable groups have consistently been taken into account in design and implementation of scenarios work. Publications on gender inclusion in CC policy were developed and disseminated to policy makers in Costa Rica, Colombia, Peru and the Philippines. Policy inventories in countries of SA have highlighted missing gender sensitivity in policies for promoting CSA. GSI are major components of plans for scaling up CSA in Nepal. Gender is mainstreamed in Ghana’s national CSA action plan and in the WA CSA alliance. Concerning ITPGRFA/MLS, women’s involvement in national policy processes has been assessed. Studies continue on the differential resilience of (and differential institutional gaps between) women and men in CCAFS sites. Kenya, Colombia and Costa Rica are implementing CSA initiatives and strengthening work on gender and social inclusion, utilising a range of CCAFS gender research and tools.

CCAFS worked with policy and research partners towards ensuring that agriculture was not excluded from the agreement. The World Business Council for Sustainable Development developed a CSA Action Plan to serve as a framework for private sector investments in CSA. CCAFS played an important role in the process as a scientific partner. With COMESA, ACPC/UNECA, CORAF/WECARD and IDRC, three submissions to UNFCCC during SBSTA 42 were made by the AGN. CIAT/CCAFS developed a CSA Country Profile for Nicaragua as input to a WB report for Nicaraguan policy makers. CCAFS’s partnership with ASEAN-CRN helped to develop an umbrella program on Climate Change Adaptation and Mitigation (CChaM), a platform for collaborative R&D, knowledge management, and capacity development in SEA.  WWF used CCAFS’s SEA scenarios for an ADB investment study. Scenarios for the Pacific region were developed by CCAFS and partners, to guide regional investments through SPC. UNDP enlisted CCAFS for Bangladesh’s NAP process. IFPRI and partners, via IMPACT modelling, informed policy and investment discussions within OECD and FAO.  WMO, WFP, and ADRA are all directing institutional investments towards climate services for smallholder farmers. Five initiatives are piloting the CCSL M&E framework; partnerships with IIED’s TAMD and DFID’s BRACED programs are highlighting learning in organisational change.  FAO Council adopted CGRFA guidelines in 2015, designed to assist national climate change adaptation planning. CCAFS analyses of INDCs were used as input to the WB\'s Climate Change Action Plan.', 'CCAFS supported the AGN in a submission on the inclusion of gender in CC to the UNFCCC during SBSTA 42. Gender received attention in some 40% of the INDCs submitted ahead of COP21. The WBCSD CSA Action Plan explicitly aims to address gender and social inequality issues, thus ensuring that private sector investments will strive to strengthen gender and social inclusion. Guidelines adopted by the CGRFA recommend that gendered uses of GRFA should be taken into consideration when developing plans for integrating GRFA into national climate change strategies, and that women and marginalized social groups should be represented in processes for the development of those strategies. CCAFS’s Gender and Inclusion Toolkit has been downloaded over 3,200 times, with users in a wide range of countries and organisations (the GSI Toolkit was one of the most popular items in the CCAFS publications repository in 2015). Contributions on gender and youth were made to strengthen the Guide to UNFCCC Negotiations on Agriculture Toolkit for Communications and Outreach, to support UNFCCC processes and feed into COP21.
