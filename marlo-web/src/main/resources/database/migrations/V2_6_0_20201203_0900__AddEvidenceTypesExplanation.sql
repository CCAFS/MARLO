They are applied after or long after that the development intervention has been completed. Due to the nature of research, EPIAs often measure benefits to large numbers of people, orto large areas of land or water.\n\nNormally one component of an EPIA study will be multiple rounds of survey data representative of a policy-relevant scale â€“state, national or regional. If a study measures adoption as well as impact (this is common) it is counted as an EPIA.",
