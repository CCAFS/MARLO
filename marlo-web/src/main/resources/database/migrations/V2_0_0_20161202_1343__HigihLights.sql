Rice is the staple food of almost a third of the population, particularly poorer communities, and the primary source of income of numerous small-scale subsistence farmers. A federation of rice growers (Fedearroz); the Centro Internacional de Agricultura Tropical (CIAT) and Colombia’s ministry of agriculture together analysed crop-related data on an unprecedented scale.  The CIAT team used data-mining techniques to analyse information from annual rice surveys, harvest monitoring records, and agronomic experiments with changing the dates of rice sowing, as well as weather data from the National Institute of Hydrology. Results suggested that for several regions climate change was the problem, and that traditional farming practices needed to change too. The results are highly site-specific. In the town of Saldaña, for example, rice yields were limited mainly by solar radiation during the grain-ripening stage. I', 'In Espinal, the biggest problem was warm nights. This suggested that farmers in Saldaña could boost yields by aligning their sowing dates with sunnier seasons, whereas those in Espinal may have needed a variety more suited the local climate. ‘When we use machine-learning techniques, we can explore non-linear functional relationships between various factors – temperature, radiation, rainfall and productivity’, says CIAT agronomist Daniel Jiménez.The analysis forecasted that the first growing season of the year would coincide with a severe dry period and that the window for planting crops would need to be delayed. A simple, site-specific message was articulated and \r\ncommunicated by Fedearroz to 170 farmers in Cordoba, a region in the north: ‘don’t plant in this sowing season’. To make sure the rice growers took the recommendation seriously, they gave pinpoint-accurate information to the farmers on either the ideal windows for planting or the best variety to grow. ‘One farmer said to me that they acted on the research because it was based on their own data,’ says Jiménez. This information helped these farmers avoid the drought and estimated economic losses of $3.6 million for that \r\nharvest.

For example, a major difficulty in measuring emissions from soils (such as nitrous oxide resulting from fertilizer application) is that it involves processing many gas samples, which is extremely time-consuming and expensive. The SAMPLES guidelines describe a new approach, validated by CCAFS researchers that allows gas samples to be pooled together prior to processing, reducing the cost of sample processing. \r\n\r\nUnique to the SAMPLES guidelines is that they provide high-level guidance: they describe all the potential methods that may be used for a particular GHG source or sink, and compare them in terms of cost, complexity, and suitability for different situations. There are, for example, many different methods of measuring methane emitted by ruminant livestock, from respiration chambers in which the animal is housed in a sealed chamber over a period of time, to gas-detecting lasers that can be used to measure methane from herds of grazing animals. Respiration chambers are the “gold standard,” but are expensive and not suited for grazing animals, so the guidelines also describe less-expensive alternatives.\r\n\r\nEqually important, the SAMPLES platform also contains a new database where GHG inventory compilers and NAMA developers can access country-specific emission factors developed by CCAFS researchers.

Low-emissions development (LED) in agriculture acknowledges that the primary purpose of agriculture is to produce food and other goods for human needs, and that climate change mitigation is a secondary goal that should not compromise production. This paper describes a research process and protocol to identify high potential LED options in agriculture at the United States Agency for International Development (USAID). The case study illustrates the steps for the identification and prioritization of LED options including: idea generation, concept development, and evidence building. Each stage is designed to gather and analyze data that specifically enable managers and stakeholders to make informed evaluations.

The incorporation of institutional factors and local contextual systems in the LED concept development stage improves the output credibility and salience.

Identifying how to maximize the impact of CSA investment starts with understanding the current institutional and policy frameworks associated with CSA, assessing CSA actions already underway, and identifying promising future CSA initiatives. \r\n\r\nIn an effort to advance knowledge and mainstream CSA, CIAT/CCAFS FP1, the World Bank, and USAID have been working together in developing national CSA baselines that highlight potential areas of investment for CSA at national and local levels. \r\n\r\nAs an overarching goal, the CSA Country Profile initiative is expected to advance CSA in the public agenda, raising awareness of the importance of financing investments that simultaneously promote productivity, adaptation and mitigation. It specifically seeks to engage governments, financing and research institutions on the CSA concept and to identify entry points for further research and investment.\r\n\r\nWith transparency and participation at the heart of this process, local knowledge and scientific evidence unite to establish realistic pathways for increasing CSA adoption and achieving outcomes for smallholder farmers. The project team consists of experts in climate change, environmental policy, agronomy, and agriculture and development policy. Data collection is based on extensive desk review, surveys, and interviews with experts and key-decision makers.', 'Supported by the World Bank, five studies were developed in 2015 (Sri Lanka, Kenya, Rwanda, Nicaragua and Uruguay), continuing the series of Country Profiles developed in 2014 for Argentina, Colombia, Costa Rica, El Salvador, Granada, Mexico and Peru. \r\n\r\nThey resulted in five 12- to 16-pages documents, outlining the country’s agricultural context, the sector’s climate-related challenges, existing and potential CSA practices and their impacts on selected CSA indicators, as well as policies, institutions and financing opportunities and challenges for CSA scale out. Combining text with infographics, these documents provide an easy-to-read, quick overview of the CSA state in a specific country.\r\n\r\nDespite the methodology being uniformly applied to all Country Profiles to ensure consistency and comparability across countries and regions, results and key considerations of the analysis are context-specific. This calls attention to at least two facts. \r\n\r\nOn one hand, that CSA options (practices, technologies, services) should not be seen as shopping lists of actions or silver-bullet solutions to solve climate-related challenges to our agricultural systems, but rather as potential areas of  intervention, which, combined, can maximize benefits to the society from a multiple perspective (social, economic, and environmental benefits). On the other hand, that countries are at different development stages and have different development pathways, requiring investment options tailored to their specific environments. \r\n\r\nFor all that, one important cross-cutting observation from these studies refers to institutionality and the need of incentives for CSA scale out. Despite being a relatively new concept, CSA has been practiced for a long time by farmers as mechanisms to cope with different external stresses. However, the important missing piece in the puzzle has oftentimes been the development of regulatory governance and institutional frameworks, critical for maximizing the opportunities from CSA practices and for mobilizing adaptation and mitigation finance to the agriculture sector.', '0', 'CCAFS FP1, CIAT', 'The CSA Country Profiles are aimed to provide a brief yet comprehensive overview of the status of CSA activities and enabling environments in a given country.

Surveys revealed that i/ the owner of the land around the pond focuses farm activities on rainfed rice cultivation during the wet season and prevent other farmers irrigating vegetables on his bare land during the dry season, ii/ in the absence of clear rules governing water accesses and use of this pond, everyone is afraid to take the water and feel as if they would be stealing the water from others. This lost potential was revisited in October 2015, when a training workshop on vegetable gardens was organized. Several meetings gathering villagers and local authorities followed. Initially, the owner was reluctant to allow other farmers to grow vegetables on his land, mentioning that vegetables could impoverish his soil. The digging of ditches and building of small dykes to irrigate watermelons were also seen as an impediment to preparing land for wet season rice production. As a compromise, farmers promised not to grow watermelons and were granted access to the coveted land.

This new banana mapper overlays climatic zones onto the map of major production areas of bananas and plantains. The zones are defined based on significant banana response criteria for annual average temperature, the difference in winter and summer temperature, total annual rainfall and the length of the dry season. The Agroclimatic Zones were also mapped using projected climate data for 2050, allowing the comparison between the current production areas and agroclimatic zones against those projected for 2050. The base map is generated by data corresponding to a characterization of the production system contained in a database, adding the possibility to evaluate each production system in terms of the current climate vs the projected climate for 2050.  A visual comparison to identify homologue and analogue sites is also possible.\r\nThe site offers two features for user interaction.  The banana production zones are built on data from official sources where available and the knowledge of local banana experts.  These data can be updated on a regular basis.  The national banana sector in a country can also call for inputs from field experts in less well documented production areas to improve the quality of the map.\r\nThe category limits for the Agroclimatic Zones can also be modified in the system upon request by users based on other climate criteria.  This is not a public feature, but allows the generation of maps and comparisons for targeted uses.  This can be done by creating an offline version of the mapper accessible to experts requesting modified zones.  The projections for climate scenarios for other time horizons are also possible, based on the same approach.', 'The development of the Agroclimatic Zones which reflect significant banana production parameters, was proposed to provide a useful approach to quantify the effects of climate change on the suitability of growing conditions across the globe.  These results were written up in a chapter for an FAO-published book on climate change and global commerce.  To make these results available to a wider audience, the overlay of current and projected future climate change onto BananaMapper was proposed.  This feature was designed to allow banana specialists collaborating in national climate change adaptation planning to provide specific input on banana to national and sub-national commissions.  The use of the electronic banana mapper as a platform offered the opportunity to banana program leaders to use both official statistics on crop production and the site-specific knowledge of banana specialists to develop more accurate maps of banana production and the relevant production and phytosanitary characteristics.  The contrast of current and projected climate for 2050 as two overlays, links specific production areas to the effects of climate change.  These two layers can also be used to identify homologue and analogue sites for any banana growing region in the world.  While the proposed parameters for the Agroclimatic Zones are based on banana relevant features, the parameters of the overlays can also be modified based on specific requests from users of the mapper.  Individual country reports are being prepared to guide national banana leaders in the advanced use of the overlays and in the upgrading of their banana production zones.   The climate change overlays are also being further validated using a leaf emission index which will be compared to banana field trials in sites across the globe.  Many of these data bases are available in AgTrials.', '1', '', 'BananaMapper originated to provide information to quantify the effects of climate change on banana suitability.

The largest variability in responses, albeit small, comes from the individual coping and adaptation strategies. However, the small variations across all questions suggest that issues related to climate change are managed at the household level rather than at the individual level. Some interesting findings from this study are that all participants surveyed have witnessed a change in weather in the last 10 years. Most notably, temperatures have increased and become more variable while precipitation has decreased. Farmers are demanding rice varieties that are heat-tolerant, drought-tolerant, and salt-tolerant; pest management training; and crop production management training. The findings outlined above affirm that the gender imbalance in the awareness and understanding of climate change issues between male and female rice farmers in the Mekong River Delta (MRD), the biggest rice bowl of Vietnam, is not a serious problem although there is a slight difference in male and female coping and adaptation strategies. This result coincides with what we have captured during several field visits and surveys in the area. Some reasons for this are mentioned below.

From 2014, there has been 100% increase in the number of goats brought to the market. Close to 4,000 goats were sold at the auction in 2015, with over 60% coming from Kapsokale CBO members.', 'The Galla goats and Red Maasai sheep have become popular in Nyando. It is projected that in the next 5 years they will replace all the other breeds in the area. In 2011, nearly 64% of the 467 households in Nyando villages had not introduced new livestock breeds. This changed in 2012 when 70 breeding units of Galla goats were introduced, and in mid-2013 when 30 breeding units of Red Maasai sheep were introduced. The households are now getting additional income from selling sheep, goats and chicken ranging between USD 266 and 300. From the 100 breeding units of Galla goats and Red Maasai sheep, a total of 1,506 crosses were registered in 2014, and increasing to 1,648 in 2015. With introduction of additional 44 breeding units towards end of 2015, the population of the resilient breeds is expected to double. At this rate, it is anticipated that the current total population of 38,725 sheep and goats (on average 57% of households keep sheep and goats) in the 106 villages could be replaced by new Galla and red Maasai crosses in five years, clearly demonstrating the  benefit of breeding and genetic improvement as climatic conditions change. The Red Maasai sheep and Galla goats have faster growth, very strong compensatory growth after long dry seasons, resistance to internal parasites, and good tolerance to trypanosomes, drought and heat stress. The cross breeds of Red Maasai sheep and Gala goats also mature earlier compared to the local breeds. It also takes less time and labor to raise small ruminants compared to large cattle, and the meat and milk gains of small ruminants far exceed cattle because they have shorter reproductive cycles and maximize grass and fodder use from grazing sheep and browsing goats.', '0', '', 'In Nyando, the indigenous small ruminants (SR) are generally left to graze on stovers from crops, and take a long time to grow to maturity (up to 4 years). Farmers know what traits they desire in their SR, and are willing to learn and change their practices in order to improve their livelihoods. CCAFS through ILRI partnered with the local CBOs to introduce resilient breeds of Galla goats and Red Maasai sheep in 2012 through 2013. The aim was to cross selected Galla goats and Red Maasai sheep with the small local East African breeds for resilience and increased productivity.', 'The partners include the Kisumu and Kericho County Departments of Agriculture and Livestock, who provide small ruminant extension services in the villages.a\r\n\r\nKenya Agricultural and Livestock Research organization (KARLO) on fodder research, production and management.\r\n\r\nWorld Neighbors and the Ministry of Agriculture, Livestock and Fisheries supported the acquisition of the necessary permits, training of community paravets and provided extension services.', null, 'Kenya’s native goats and sheep, expertly crossbred, are key to helping farmers cope with climate change\r\nhttp://news.ilri.org/2015/07/10/kenyas-native-goats-and-sheep-expertly-crossbred-are-key-to-helping-farmers-cope-with-climate-change/\r\n\r\nSustainable small ruminant breeding program for climate-smart villages in Kenya\r\nhttps://ccafs.cgiar.org/publications/sustainable-small-ruminant-breeding-program-climate-smart-villages-kenya#.VtYRyOZKZ2E\r\n\r\nHeat Tolerant, Tough Teeth, Lots Of Milk — They\'re Supergoats!\r\nhttp://www.npr.org/blogs/goatsandsoda/2015/03/26/395613089/heat-tolerant-tough-teeth-lots-of-milk-theyre-supergoats\r\n\r\nPhotos - https://www.flickr.com/photos/cgiarclimate/sets/72157650141485634\r\n\r\nNewspaper article -  http://www.nation.co.ke/business/seedsofgold/New-goat-breed-promises-high-yields/-/2301238/2725846/-/5nfsogz/-/index.html\r\n\r\n\r\nOjango JMK, Audho J, Oyieng E, Recha J, Muigai A. 2015.

Initial work on the model, which grew out of the SAVANNA and DAYCENT models at Colorado State University, was supported by ILRI and CCAFS, and the model is now being used to evaluate the possible impacts of climate change on the rangelands of the world.  The model makes a new contribution to the study of rangelands, as it builds on a great deal of previous work but in a relatively simplified form.  In 2015 we carried out working linking G-Range with new, CMIP5 climate data, running a variety of different scenarios.', 'Future projected changes in Aboveground Net Primary Productivity (ANPP) in Africa’s rangelands during the present century were simulated for two future emissions pathways: intermediate (RCP4.5) and high-end (RCP8.5). Changes in ANPP for RCP4.5 are relatively modest to the end of the century (~20%), with similarly modest changes in herb, shrub and tree cover (in the range 10-24%). In\r\ncontrast, ANPP under RCP8.5 sees a 50% reduction in ANPP by the end of the century, caused for the most part by an 80% reduction in tree cover. Negative changes in ANPP by the 2050s under RCP8.5 are widespread throughout the continent’s rangelands, with some positive percentage changes in pockets of central, eastern and northern Africa.\r\n\r\nChanges in the balance between herbs and shrubs could provide important insights into changes in suitability of the rangelands for different types of animals (e.g., browsers versus grazers). The results of G-Range simulations indicate that substantial changes in livestock feed resources will occur during the present century, and in large parts of the continent these changes will be detrimental. Many of these areas in the mixed crop-livestock systems will also see decreases in the quantity and quality of crop residues, putting further\r\npressure on livestock feeding resources, reducing food security, and increasing the risk of hunger and undernutrition for millions of livestock keepers, many of whom will have only limited capacity to adapt.\r\n\r\nThis work has now been done for the whole globe, and is being written up for publication during 2016.', '1', 'CCAFS', 'There is a great deal of information on the impacts of climate change on crop production in the tropics, but much less on livestock production.

After identifying the main risks and potential solutions for climate risk management, alongside producers, the project partners focused on designing and validating an index. The design and validation was an iterative process carried out throughout the first year and a half of the project, where producers provided feedback on the product’s performance with respect to their experiences in the field. \r\nThe second year of activities focused on designing and conducting an experimental dry-run (or non commercial pilot) in the El Paraíso Department, working with over 200 basic grains producers. The dry-run activities have a two-fold purpose: education and research. The educational component aims at working with producers throughout an agricultural year to help them understand how index insurance works and how it can work within their productive systems. The key research component of the experimental activities allows project partners and stakeholders to gather information about producers’ preferences when faced with a portfolio of climate risk management strategies and answer key questions that can help better structure the commercial product. Additionally, these activities help stakeholders monitor the index’s performance, to identify potential improvements that can help the product better assess the farmers’ needs. With this information, the third year of the project will focus on structuring and piloting the first index insurance commercial product in Honduras.', 'In the past two years, while working with over 340 farmers (in associations reaching over 3,000 producers in the Dry Corridor) and training over 50 representatives of 22 NGOs (with about 463 person-trained hours), government agencies, academia, and private sector actors, the IRI has built participatory processes to design, prototype and test a drought index insurance product based on satellite precipitation estimates. \r\nCurrently, the project aims to scale to other regions of interest, to support climate risk management efforts and allow further financial inclusion of rural communities leading to development.\r\nPublic and private sector stakeholders have discussed the need to improve access to credit among rural communities, where farmers are often marginalized by a hesitating private sector seeing the risk of loan default due to climate and other risks. Because existing traditional insurance schemes are too costly to implement at a smallholder farmer level, insurance companies have not been able to penetrate the rural sector. Thus, stakeholders expressed the validity of implementing an index insurance product that would allow insurance companies to provide their services to previously inaccessible clients and extend the potential for rural communities to take productive opportunities. \r\nEven though the private sector is hesitant to implement innovative schemes, through ongoing capacity building and technical support efforts this initiative and the public sector supporters understand the great potential for a surge in demand for index insurance from end users and providers alike. Interest has been expressed in the potential to scale the current index not only to other regions, but also to other important crops, like coffee. Currently considered are options such as credit-bundled, input-bundled or stand-alone products that can facilitate the reach of financial mechanisms to support the development of the agricultural sector and the improvement of food security in the target regions.', '0', 'CCAFS', 'The efforts led by IRI in Honduras aim to generate local capacity to design and implement index insurance schemes for rural development and food security.

Most recently working with DICTA, SAG’s technology and information unit, to define how to support the development of additional indexed products, while supporting the implementation of the current pilot product. Additionally, through SAG the initiative has been able to connect to other climate information efforts ongoing in COPECO and have collaboratively defined a working pathway to support the development of climate services and the potential for COPECO to serve as a third-party index calculation agency responsible of providing clear and accurate information to both the private sector insurance providers and farmers themselves. \r\nZamorano has provided technical as well as local coordination support to this activity. Through their efforts and established connections, they help coordinate activities such as field visits, which are necessary to ensure the product meets end-users demand. In addition, as an academic institution, Zamorano has provided research support, by introducing their local knowledge into research activities conducted to test the product. Additionally, by developing Zamorano’s capacity to develop index insurance, the initiative has assured the potential for scaling to new regions and other products, through leveraged funds. For example, Zamorano would support participatory feedback gathering in the field and continue to develop other products as demanded by the private and public sector, with IRI as a strategic partner.', null, 'http://iri.columbia.edu/news/video-what-tools-do-honduran-farmers-want-for-climate-risk/  \r\nhttps://cloud.iri.columbia.edu/index.php/s/rGbSGP2YejFVyU6 \r\nhttps://ccafs.cgiar.org/es/blog/conociendo-sobre-riesgos-clim%C3%A1ticos-en-la-agricultura-empecemos-por-el-%E2%80%98%C3%ADndice%E2%80%99#.Vs5SbJMrKRs \r\nhttps://ccafs.cgiar.org/es/blog/decisiones-m%C3%A1s-seguras-para-enfrentar-la-sequ%C3%ADa#.Vs5SbpMrKRs', 'Index insurance, Participatory processes, Rural development, Food security, Climate risk management,  Human centered design', 'Index Insurance', '2015', '1', '1', '2016-03-02 14:16:09', '18', '18', '');

We examine the relation between participatory intra-household decision making – as a set of ‘rules of the game’ that reduces information and bargaining power asymmetries – and cooperative, i.e. more efficient, sustainable and equitable, outcomes in smallholder coffee farming households in Uganda. We find experimental evidence that participatory decision making is positively related to investments in the common household farm. Consumption behaviour however is not fairer nor more sustainable. Participatory decision\r\nmaking is associated with more cooperative actual outcomes such as greater investment in sustainable intensification, consideration of women’s interests, fairer reproductive intra-household labour division, more balanced control over cash crop income and improved livelihoods.', 'Different elements in our analysis point to a higher likelihood of cooperative out comes when agricultural households, as collective action institutions, adopt favourable ‘rules of the game’, in this case participatory intra-household decision making about production and resource allocation. Participatory intra-household decision making about household farm production and consumption possibly contributes to reducing information asymmetries and (bargaining) power imbalances between spouses and, as such, inspires more cooperative outcomes, i.e. more sustainable, efficient and equitable household farming systems.\r\n\r\nWe identify three main ways forward to further explore the relationship between intra-household decision making and efficient, sustainable and equitable household farming. First, a random introduction of a program encouraging participatory decision making would allow attributing more confidently changes in household farm investment and consumption behaviour to changes in intra-household decision making. Secondly, it could be enlightening to study approaches that aim to change intra-household decision making by enhancing women’s bargaining power through building women’s human capital, income or asset base. Thirdly, a more cooperative outcome may also consist of a whole different household farming system, a changed combination of food crops, cash crops and livestock.

The manuscript makes use of innovative data mining and non-linear modeling techniques.  The results agree with household and other survey data across SSA producing functional relationships between population density and soil pH with agricultural expansion.  Climate and physiological covariates (derived from Earth observation) commonly used to map land cover change, were less important.', 'The model was developed with 2,252 5x5 km2 sample frames of the proportion of several land cover types in Kenya.  70 socio-ecological covariates of LULCC available seamlessly across sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) were collected and processed for model development.

Generalized additive models for each land cover type were then constructed on a calibration subset using the highest ranked covariates.  Population density on a continuous basis and soil pH were the most important covariates of agriculture and natural vegetation change, each model explaining 63% and 66% of the variance in the validation subset, respectively.

The increase in height of the grass strips (up to 1-1.2m) caused by accumulating soil materials has formed natural terraces. The topsoil at each terrace has become better aerated, richer in soil carbon content. The addition of soil carbon stock has come largely from decayed cassava stems and leaves that were left scattered on the surface as mulch and contour barriers made from cassava stems. Cassava stems after a harvest was piled up along contour lines following the dimensions: 50-60cm (height) – 50-60cm (length) – 30-40cm (width).
