Baseline situation and pest-smart interventions explored from farmers’ pest management in target CSVs were evaluated and demonstrated. \r\nIn the Philippines, the second phase of Infomediaries campaign, a communication channel that disseminates CSA information through high-school students, showed great changes in student perception on CC and its impacts. Findings from the campaign have been documented. A pilot radio campaign to mobilize the rural sector for CC mitigation and adaptation was implemented by PFRB. Highlights of 3 workshops and broadcast materials in local languages were shared with interested radio stations.', 'There were various trainings conducted by partners to introduce new CC adaptation and mitigation options to farmers. Together with training, field demonstration was established at CSVs as a visual way to encourage farmers’ adoption. We mobilized high school students as information providers on climate-smart agriculture (in the Philippines). By using this channel, CSA information can be transfer to their parents, neighbors, relative and whole community. Besides, we conducted kick-off meeting at study sites to attract attention of communities. Workshops, blog, journal article and study-tour are other ways that were used to share outputs to farmers, science community and local authorities.', 'List of project outputs for P115.docx', '1', '2014-09-25 07:27:06', '26', '193', '');

For addressing these nutrient requirements, smart fertilizer management options and agronomic practices (e.g. liming, applying available organic residues and manures) will be identified and assessed (for productivity and environmental impacts including GHGs), resulting in site and crop-specific fertilizer best management practices (BMPs). Most promising BMPs, also in terms of farm income and social acceptability will be selected, tested experimentally (on-farm and on-station) and piloted. These practices may be rolled out by local extension services, CCAFS networks and the fertilizer industry, to the benefit of smallholders.
