The CCAFS national science?policy exchange platforms will form the backbone for a top?down and bottom?up mainstreaming of climate change into national development frameworks by (1) catalyzing multi-scale, participatory identification of priorities and knowledge gaps using appropriate tools and inclusive approaches to define priority investments, and (2) learning from multi- and trans- disciplinary action research in selected districts of three pilot countries. The existing national platforms will be involved in the capacity building process by providing technical, scientific and political supports to local communities.

Improved agricultural practices, although targeted at food security and resilience to climate change, may not be attractive without systematic and scientific basis that addresses actual biophysical or socio-economic constraints to improved agricultural productivity. Evidence further highlights that adaptation practices need to be site-specific, tailored according to environmental conditions and with regard to available livelihood options (Kristjanson et al., 2012). In Tanzania, the lack of such framework and system, including knowledge of soil and land health indicators, limits the utility and application of results from crop suitability models and bio-economic models for current and future climate scenarios, especially at the farm scale. The rapid pace of climate change and the threat of its impact on global food security, requires that adaptation and mitigation measures be put into place with an urgency to match (Vermeulen et al., 2011). Using the strengths of scientists across multiple disciplines, we hope to accelerate the rate of adoption of CSA practices and technologies that will help farmers both adapt to and mitigate the effects of climate change by developing and implementing an integrative climate adaptation platform that builds on an interdisciplinary environmental, agricultural and socio-economic framework, with inputs from national and international partners.\r\nThe “Climate Smart Technologies and Practices: Using Science Knowledge and Expert Feedback to Accelerate Local Adoption” project proposes to accelerate adoption of site-appropriate, climate smart agricultural practices in the Usambara Mountains in Tanzania.

Beyond these broader reforms, lie specific mitigation policies like ‘agricultural offsets’  which provide a mechanism by which sectors facing higher marginal abatement costs can tap low cost mitigation opportunities within agriculture. In some instances, realizing mitigation opportunities within agriculture may also offer potential to further enhance existing Indian programs and policies aimed at increasing agricultural productivity and improving the sustainability of India’s farming systems.
