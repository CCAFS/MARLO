projects.LP6Contribution.infoText=LP6 is in charge of generating, translating and synthesizing climate change knowledge at the regional and global levels so that actions in relation to CSA can reach millions of farmers and key stakeholders from the rural world. Through LP6 - partnerships, capacity building, global outreach and climate finance- will be mobilized accompanied by a strong knowledge management and communications strategy. The latter will provide an enable environment to bring more quality solutions in the context of climate variability, climate change and uncertainty about future climate conditions, to more farmers in a fast and equitable manner.

projects.LP6Contribution.helpText=<p><b>LP6</b> is in charge of generating, translating and synthesizing climate change knowledge at the regional and global levels so that actions in relation to CSA can reach millions of farmers and key stakeholders from the rural world. Through LP6 - partnerships, capacity building, global outreach and climate finance- will be mobilized accompanied by a strong knowledge management and communications strategy. The latter will provide an enable environment to bring more quality solutions in the context of climate variability, climate change and uncertainty about future climate conditions, to more farmers in a fast and equitable manner.<br>Key actions of LP6 include the following:</p><ol><li><b>INTEGRATING:</b> LP6 will consolidate CCAFS as the climate change leader across the CGIAR. The latter includes working towards breaking down barriers among centres and CRPs, making connections among scientists, promoting regional to global linkages, and better CRP to CRP connections.</li><li><b>SYNTHESISING AND RESEARCHING:</b> LP6 will deliver demand driven knowledge with respect to metrics, scalable approaches, more radical/innovative/sexier options and best bets by country/agro-ecological zone in order to address knowledge needs of regional and global policy processes and partners.</li><li><b>ENGAGING:</b> LP6 will use global reach to facilitate connections, opportunities, sharing of knowledge, and engagement of CRPs and Centres in events and partnerships.</li><li><b>MOBILIZING INVESTMENT:</b> LP6 will support innovative  solutions that can remove barriers and increase climate investments in land-use. It will do so by strengthening capacities, generating cutting edge knowledge, developing and delivering demand-driven products and services and promoting innovative partnerships and collaboration.</li><li><b>COMMUNICATING:</b> LP6 will work closely with diverse type of partners to generate and implement communication strategies so that the CGIAR work on climate change can reach millions of people around the world.</li><li><b>ENHANCING CAPACITY:</b> LP6 will provide tools and options so that the agricultural community, including the research community, private and public sector, farmers\u2019 organizations, and national and international agencies, are able to implement options provided to tackle the climate change challenge.</li></ol>
