If the deliverable applies to a specific cross cutting theme, please select it from the menu or select not applicable (N/A). Select an output to associate the deliverable with a specific output linked to this project. Please add supporting documentation, such as a link to the deliverable in CGspace. 
monitoring.outcome.help=In this section you will report any progress towards your outcome statement and outcome milestones set in the Impact Pathway section. You can also add outcome milestones to show progress observed. In the description of the narrative, include evidence such as interview with key informant, survey, outcome harvesting, workshop evaluation report, adoption rate, etc.  Support your evidence by including a link to a document in CGSpace or other repository (dataverse, etc).
monitoring.outcome.help.yellow=When writing your narrative, consider changes observed in next-user behavior, i.e. knowledge, attitudes, skills, or practices. Provide evidence of this change.
