# Glossary
home.glossary.activities.definition=We consider size 250K USD multi-year activities. We need to ensure that we are capturing also activities that are smaller than that, but yet key in achieving the set outcomes. Therefore, we need to enfold them as an activity within your priority larger activities. Activities like this will be led by an <b>Activity Leader</b>.
home.glossary.attribution.definition=The causality between observed (or expected) changes and an output from research or related activity.  Attribution refers to both isolating and estimating the particular contribution of a program/project to the outcome/impact.
home.glossary.endUsers.definition=Are the beneficiary population, usually quite massive, making it unfeasible for a priority or program to work with them directly.
home.glossary.effectiveness.definition=The extent to which the program or priority objectives were achieved, or are expected to be achieved, taking into account the exploratory nature and risks inherent to research.
home.glossary.formativeEvaluation.definition=Focuses on program/project implementation and is improvement-oriented.
home.glossary.summativeEvaluation.definition=Focuses on assessing worth of the program/project and lessons learnt (results and consequences), for instance to enable assessments with respect to change, continuation or enlargement of the program/project.
home.glossary.impactPathway.definition=The causal pathway for a research priority or program that outlines the expected sequence to achieve desired objectives beginning with inputs, moving through activities and outputs, and culminating in outcomes and impacts. Assumptions underpinning the causal chain and feed\u2010back loops are usually included (Closely related terms include Logical Framework and Theory of Change.)
home.glossary.managementLiason.definition=Is the person who controls the budget for the priority, they are responsible for it from the programmatic, either regional, flagship or CU portfolio perspective and will be the ones that 1) pre-fill a) their respective portfolio plans (impact pathways, with indicator and targets), b) the (contractual) project details and 2) will coordinate feedback to the projects at the various stages (e.g. planning, reporting) and 3) they will be the ones who need to summarize and synthesize from what they get reported from the priorities.

home.glossary.outcomestory.definition=see Priority Outcome Story
home.glossary.project=Priority
home.glossary.project.definition=The individual projects of research of development that contribute to a major research action. Each Flagship is made up of multiple projects, which in turn may be made up of multiple activities.

home.glossary.projectOutcomeStory.definition=We are asking at the planning stage for you to anticipate any story that gives evidence of your priority activities contributing to some behavioral changes in the coming year. This is just a guess and you might identify a different story at the reporting stage, but we have found it useful for the projects to aim for these stories as it helped priority teams to be more aware of looking out for these kind of stories to report.
