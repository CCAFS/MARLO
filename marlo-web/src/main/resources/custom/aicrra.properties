Please consider the following in summarizing, where possible, (i) distinguish those outputs which build on earlier work, and those clearly resulting from new areas of investment, (ii) how the achievement contributes to the CGIAR delivering on the corresponding Intermediate outcomes (IDO/sub-IDO).

Please provide information on all relevant SRF targets for a single study or innovation, to the extent possible. Example: please see in the 2017 report Annex Table A how findings from a single rice review have been allocated between targets for adoption, poverty and yield increases. Insofar as possible, please also disaggregate the effect of different innovations (e.g. in the above example NERICA rice could potentially be separated from another group of CGIAR rice varieties). <br /><br />If the adoption or impact data comes from a relevant innovation or contribution of the CGIAR prior to the PTF start-up (e.g. varieties released before the PTF start-up, which for most PTFs would be approximately 2012), then please support statements with published references, as shown in the 2017 Annual Report Annex Table A above. <u>Nearly all adoption or impact studies fall into the above category.</u> There are (as yet) a <u>few</u> cases (two in 2017) in which the estimated figures for at-scale adoption or impact result from an innovation released within the PTF period, for example some biofortification numbers in 2017. If this is the case, then the statement <u>must</u> be supported by a link to an Outcome/ Impact Case Report <b>Maturity Level 3</b> (preferably in the Results Dashboard or if not, with unique identifier from any appropriate repository, e.g. CGSpace).<br /><br />For any help or further clarification, please contact <u>planningandreporting@cgiar.org</u>
