### Run notes (2026-10-28)

- **Persona drift (pending item for `staging`).** `akili doctor --agents` reports all four `.agents/*.md`
  personas as `UNMARKED` (no version markers). `--fix` would rewrite shared files on a spec branch, which the
  shared-file rule forbids. Decision (owner asked for the Leader's recommendation): run with the current
  personas and apply `akili doctor --agents --fix` on `staging`.
- **Concurrency.** Another session holds a `cargo:run` (started by `run-marlo-java17.sh`) in this checkout.
  T02 and every later Maven task wait until it stops (owner's choice). T01 needs no Maven run.
- **T00** (production read-only check, OPS-003) is the owner's task. It is pending and must be done before T03.

## Task Execution History

### T01 — M1: fix the `Planing` typo — PASS

- **Date:** 2026-10-28
- **Final status:** PASS (attempt 1)
- **Requirements covered:** DA-001, MIG-001, MIG-002 (M1 column), OPS-004 (M1 part), INT-4.
- **Effort / skills:** `high` (migration on production data; the effort dial says `max`, but `max` is barred on
  T2, and the SQL is one text-match statement). Skills: `marlo-migration`. `marlo-commit` was dropped from the
  brief because the Leader commits.

#### Attempt 1

- **Files changed:** `marlo-web/src/main/resources/database/migrations/V2_6_0_20261028_1817__FixPlaningPhaseDescription.sql`
  (new; the name came from the `marlo-migration` script, using the real clock).
- **Statement:** `UPDATE phases SET description = 'Planning' WHERE description = 'Planing';`. The header states:
  no ids, DML only, the reason, the OPS-004 capture `SELECT id, description FROM phases WHERE description = 'Planing';`
  for the release notes, and that rollback must not go by text alone.
- **Implementer verification:** throwaway-schema harness `m1_harness.sh` (session scratchpad). It builds a
  `zz_m1_*` schema per scenario from the `aiccradb_actsave` structure and data, with both `phases` FKs
  re-added, and runs the migration file itself. Expected = `COUNT(*) WHERE description='Planing'` taken just
  before the run, on the same schema. Actual = `ROW_COUNT()`. It also checks other columns, collateral rows
  and leftover `Planing` rows, then drops every `zz_*` schema.

  ```
  1 real copy, first run             expected=12  actual=12  other_cols_changed=0 repaired_rows=12 planing_left=0 collateral=0  PASS
  2 same copy, second run            expected=0   actual=0   other_cols_changed=0 repaired_rows=0 planing_left=0 collateral=0  PASS
  3 no global unit, no phase         expected=0   actual=0   other_cols_changed=0 repaired_rows=0 planing_left=0 collateral=0  PASS
  4 global units, no phases          expected=0   actual=0   other_cols_changed=0 repaired_rows=0 planing_left=0 collateral=0  PASS
  5 no AICCRA                        expected=6   actual=6   other_cols_changed=0 repaired_rows=6 planing_left=0 collateral=0  PASS
  6 later unit also AICCRA           expected=12  actual=12  other_cols_changed=0 repaired_rows=12 planing_left=0 collateral=0  PASS
  7 orphan phase (unit NULL)         expected=1   actual=1   other_cols_changed=0 repaired_rows=1 planing_left=0 collateral=0  PASS
  8 inconsistent row (445 upkeep=0)  expected=12  actual=12  other_cols_changed=0 repaired_rows=12 planing_left=0 collateral=0  PASS
  9 extra: decoy 'Plan B' row        expected=12  actual=12  other_cols_changed=0 repaired_rows=12 planing_left=0 collateral=0  PASS
  remaining zz_ schemas: 0
  ```
- **No id literal:** `grep -nE "[0-9]{2,}"` finds hits only on header comment lines, and they are spec ids
  (`…-001-T01`, `DA-001`). The UPDATE contains no digit.
- **Falsifier (deviation, see Issues):**
  - The task's falsifier, `LIKE 'Plan%'` (scenario 1 actual exceeds expected), did **not** go red.
  - The author added scenario 9 (a decoy `Plan B` row) as a substitute. The `LIKE` variant then gives:
    `9 extra: decoy 'Plan B' row  expected=12  actual=13  other_cols_changed=0 repaired_rows=12 planing_left=0 collateral=1  FAIL`.
- **`marlo-migration` checklist (from the Implementer's report):**
  - no assumed ids;
  - idempotent (scenario 2);
  - DML only, with no FK column touched;
  - FK order and backfill: n/a;
  - tested on throwaway schemas (scenarios 2–5, 7);
  - the only environment assumption is that the `Planing` text exists; with 0 matching rows the run still succeeds;
  - collation caveat: `phases.description` is `utf8mb3_general_ci`, so the match is case- and trailing-space-insensitive. No such variant exists locally.
- **Evidence re-run (non-author, Leader-inline):** `m1_harness.sh` and `m1_harness.sh falsifier.sql` were
  re-executed and gave identical output. **VERIFIED.**
- **Reviewer verdict:** PASS (`opus`, checklist mode). It confirmed:
  - the harness executes the repository file (`cat "$MIG"` in the same session that reads `ROW_COUNT()`), not a copy;
  - the filename and version order: it is the newest `V2_6_0_*` file and no `V2_7+` exists;
  - the no-id claim;
  - the OPS-004 header;
  - the substitute falsifier is valid.
  
  ISSUES: none. ADVISORY: none (under 50 LOC).
- **runtime events:** none.
- **spawns:**
  - implementer 12 calls, 94,400 tokens, ended complete;
  - reviewer 10 calls, 52,959 tokens, ended complete.

#### Issues encountered

- **Spec tension, raised at the T01 gate.** The T01 falsifier in `tasks.md` cannot go red when measured with the
  mysql CLI. `ROW_COUNT()` counts *changed* rows: `Planning`→`Planning` changes nothing, and no real description
  other than `Planing` / `Planning` starts with `Plan`. The decoy-row scenario proves what the falsifier was
  meant to prove: the harness catches a WHERE clause that matches too much.
- **Reviewer note to carry.** Through Flyway (Connector/J, `useAffectedRows=false`), an UPDATE reports *matched*
  rows, not changed rows. So the update count in a release log is not comparable with the harness's `actual` if
  the WHERE ever widens.

#### Decisions made

- 2026-10-28 — Execute-time spec edit, approved by the owner at the T01 gate: the `tasks.md` T01 *Falsifier* and
  *Red run* were reworded to the decoy-row scenario, and the observed red was recorded. No requirement's meaning
  changed. The next task's Reviewer brief carries this as a named conformance check.

#### Running totals vs budget (design §17)

- Tasks closed: 1 of 16.
- LOC: 21 (budget for T01: 15; total ~1,270).
- Review rounds: 1 (budget ~24).
- Within the tripwire.
